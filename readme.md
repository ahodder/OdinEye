OdinEye is an Odin port for the Coogle project
heavily inspired by TsodingDaily from youtube:

This project is used to search the odin core and vendor libraries to perform fuzzy searches to
find functions. A stretch goal would be to also print an associated documentation.

To use OdinEye:

    odineye -rv "SomeReturnType" -args "SomeArgList"
